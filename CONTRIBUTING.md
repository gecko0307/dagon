# Contributing Guidelines

####  Bug reporting 

Open an issue at [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/gecko0307/dagon/issues). Before doing that, ensure the bug was not already reported or fixed in `master` branch. Describe a problem and, if necessary, provide minimal code needed to reproduce it.

Note that macOS compatibility issues are not considered bugs. Dagon uses OpenGL and doesn't support macOS where OpenGL is deprecated.

####  Bug fixing 

Open a new GitHub pull request with your patch. Provide a description of the problem and solution. Follow our [code style](#code-style-and-standards).

#### Implementing new features

New code should at least:
* work under Windows and POSIX systems and provide platform-agnostic API
* support x86 and x86_64 targets
* use OpenGL 4.0 and GLSL 4.00 (core profile)
* use [dlib](https://github.com/gecko0307/dlib) for game math, image decoding, file I/O and other tasks dlib was created for
* follow our [code style](#code-style-and-standards)
* use transparent dynamic memory allocations. Ideally the code should not allocate at all or rely on user for that. Garbage collector usage is not allowed. If dynamic allocations can't be avoided, they should be done with `dlib.core.memory`. All classes should use `dlib.core.ownership`
* not violate copyright/licensing. When adapting third-party code, make sure that it is compatible with [Boost Software License 1.0](https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt).

Adding new external dependencies should be avoided as much as possible. Only GC-free third-party D libraries are allowed. C libraries should be linked via BindBC binding.

#### Branching strategy

`master` branch is a development branch for the next release. When release is ready, a release branch is created from `master` (for example, `dev_0.10`). Release branches are not merged back into `master`, they are used to fix bugs and make minor updates.

####  Code style and standards 

Dagon follows [D style](https://dlang.org/dstyle.html). Essential rules are the following:
* Use spaces instead of tabs. Each indentation level is 4 spaces
* Opening curly bracket should be on a new line
* Functions and variables should be in `camelCase`
* Types, constants and enums should be in `PascalCase`
* Module names should be in lowercase.

Each D module should start with a Boost license block prepended with a copyright notice:
