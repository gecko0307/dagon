# Jolt Physics

[Jolt Physics](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics) is a robust and performant Open Source real-time physics engine by Jorrit Rouwe of Guerrilla Games. Battle-tested in AAA production, Jolt is gaining popularity and is used by major free game engines such as Godot, NeoAxis, GDevelop, Gaijin Entertainment's Dagor Engine, and many others. Dagon includes Jolt as an alternative to Newton. They provide roughly the same feature set, but Jolt has higher potential, supporting advanced features like soft bodies, ragdolls and vehicle simulation.
