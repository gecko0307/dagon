/**
 * Animation for entity properties.
 *
 * Description:
 * The `dagon.graphics.tween` module defines the `Tween` struct,
 * which supports smooth interpolation (tweening) of `Entity` properties
 * such as position, rotation, scaling, and color over time, using various
 * easing functions. Tweens can be paused, played, restarted, repeated, and killed,
 * and are typically used for procedural animation, cutscenes, and UI effects.
