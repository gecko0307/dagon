/**
 * Plain text asset.
 *
 * Description:
 * The `dagon.resource.text` module defines the `TextAsset` class for
 * loading, storing, and managing text files as assets. Text assets are useful
 * for configuration files, scripts, shader sources, or any other textual data
 * that needs to be loaded and managed by the asset system. The module provides
 * threaded loading, integration with the asset manager, and virtual file system
 * support.
