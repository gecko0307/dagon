/**
 * GLTF skin.
 *
 * Description:
 * The `dagon.resource.gltf.skin` module defines the `GLTFSkin` class,
 * which represents a skin in a GLTF asset, including joint nodes and
 * inverse bind matrices. Skins are used for skeletal animation and GPU
 * skinning, associating a set of joints (bones) with mesh vertices.
 * The module supports loading joint hierarchies and inverse bind matrices
 * from GLTF files.
