/**
 * Material asset.
 *
 * Description:
 * The `dagon.resource.material` module defines the `MaterialAsset` class
 * for loading, parsing, and managing material resources from text files.
 * Material assets are parsed into property sets and can be used to instantiate
 * `Material` objects. The module supports threaded loading, integration with
 * the asset manager, and property parsing via Dagon's property system.
