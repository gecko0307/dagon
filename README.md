The goal of this project is to create a modern, easy to use, extensible 3D game engine for [D language](https://dlang.org/). Dagon is based on OpenGL 4.3 core profile and SDL2. It currently works on Windows and Linux.

> Note: this project is not connected to Dagon engine by Senscape. Also not to be confused with Dagor engine by Gaijin Entertainment.

Dagon uses computation-heavy graphics techniques and so requires a fairly powerful graphics card to run (Ampere-based NVIDIA GPUs are recommended for optimal performance). The engine is only desktop, support for mobile and web platforms is not planned.

If you like Dagon, support its development on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gecko0307) or [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/gecko0307). You can also make a one-time donation via [NOWPayments](https://nowpayments.io/donation/gecko0307). I appreciate any support. Thanks in advance!

Getting Started
---------------
The recommended way to start using Dagon is creating a game template with `dub init`. Create an empty directory for the project, cd to it and run the following:
```
dub init --type=dagon
dub build
```

Do not delete `data/__internal` folder! It is used to store engine's internal data such as shaders and textures.

Most of them are automatically deployed on 64-bit Windows and Linux. Read more [here](https://github.com/gecko0307/dagon/blob/master/doc/Runtime%20Dependencies.md).

Under Linux, if you want to use local libraries in Windows way (from application's working directory rather than from the system), add the following to your `dub.json`:

```
"lflags-linux": ["-rpath=$$ORIGIN"]
```

Known Bugs and Limitations
--------------------------
* The engine doesn't support macOS
* dagon:nuklear extension has [problems](https://github.com/gecko0307/dagon/issues/89) under Linux
* dagon:newton crashes under Linux when loading Newton plugins (`NewtonPhysicsWorld.loadPlugins`)
